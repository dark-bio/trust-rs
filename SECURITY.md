# Security policy

This crate holds the root keys of the Dark Bio ecosystem and verifies the
attestations issued under them. Everything downstream trusts what it decides,
so reports are taken seriously and handled quickly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for anything that looks like a security
problem. Send a private email to peter@dark.bio instead, with a description of
the issue, the affected version and, if you have one, a way to reproduce it.
You will get an acknowledgement within a few days, and updates as the fix
progresses.

The root keys themselves are published in the transparency reports repository,
which is the place to look if a key seems wrong. A root that has to be retired
is retired there first, and this crate follows with a release.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release on crates.io receives fixes. Versions are 0.x and every
minor bump may change the API, so fixes ship as new versions rather than
backports. Consumers should track the latest release.

## Disclosure

Fixes are released first and disclosed afterwards. Once a fixed version is on
crates.io, an advisory is filed with the RustSec database so that `cargo audit`
users learn about it, and the report is credited unless you prefer otherwise.
